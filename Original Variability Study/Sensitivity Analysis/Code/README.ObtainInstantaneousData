This README offers an in depth description of the "Obtain Instantaneous Data (t = ..s).ipynb" Jupyter notebook, as it appears in multiple 
folders throughout my "Masters Thesis" directory:

    1) /storage/work/bsh5393/Masters Thesis/Near-Storm PseudoSoundings/CASE1-Southern Box/Scripts/Obtain Instantaneous Data (t = 30s).ipynb
    
    2) /storage/work/bsh5393/Masters Thesis/Near-Storm PseudoSoundings/CASE2-Southeastern Box/Scripts/Obtain Instantaneous Data (t = 
    30s).ipynb
    
    3) /storage/work/bsh5393/Masters Thesis/Pre-Storm PseudoSoundings/Scripts/Obtain Instantaneous Data (t = 0s).ipynb
    
    4) /storage/work/bsh5393/Masters Thesis/Original Variability Study/Scripts/Obtain Instantaneous Data (t = 30s).ipynb
    
    5) /storage/work/bsh5393/Masters Thesis/Original Variability Study/Sensitivity Analysis/Code/Obtain Instantaneous Data (t = 30s).ipynb
    
The notebook is more or less identical in all of the above folders, with the only difference being different input data (storm-free simulation 
vs. orignal parent simulation).

Since the notebooks are divided into many cells, and there already existing comments above each line of code, additional remarks or 
clarifications are given below, organized by cell number (from top to bottom of the notebook).
