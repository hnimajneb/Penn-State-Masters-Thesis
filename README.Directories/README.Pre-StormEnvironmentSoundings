This README offers a deeper dive and description of all the contents and subdirectories within the "Pre-Storm Environment Soundings" directory. This is the portion of my work that is all about the ensemble of 20th-century style simulations, attempting to show the range of outcomes from randomly selected point-soundings from a realistic environment.

Each section below is dedicated to explaining each subdirectory individually. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Data subdirectory is organized as follows:

        1) storm_motions.pkl
            - This Python pickle file stores the storm motions computed at 5 minute intervals for each of the 30 simulations.
            - source script: SIGTOR vs. WEAKTOR vs. NONTOR Environments.ipynb

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Figure Builder subdirectory is used to create GIFs within my scripts. The figures in this folder are constantly overwritten since it is temporary storage.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Figures subdirectory is empty, as most important figures are within the output of the script cells themselves.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The GIFs subdirectory contains all GIFs pertaining to the ensemble of simulations. There are a few types of GIFs in this folder:

    - Prelim_GIF_{...}.gif: These are animations of single ensemble members showing shaded reflectivity with black vertical 
    velocity contours (w = 5, 10, 15, .. m/s).
    
    - Full_Storm{..}.gif OR grw_Full_Storm{..}.gif: These are animations of single ensemble members showing shaded ground 
    relative wind with red vertical vorticity contours. The 30 dBZ line at z = 522 m shows the rough outline of the supercell is 
    plotted as a solid white line. 
    
    - qv_Full_Storm{..}.gif: These are animations of single ensemble members showing shaded water vapor mixing ratio with red 
    vertical vorticity contours. The 30 dBZ line at z = 522 m shows the rough outline of the supercell is plotted as a solid 
    white line. 
    
    - full_ensemble_dbz.gif & full_ensemble_grw.gif: These are animations of the full ensemble showing basic shaded reflectivity 
    with vertical velocity contours and shaded ground relative wind with vertical vorticity contours, respectively.

The Scripts subdirectory is organized as follows:

    1) Animate Simulations.ipynb
    
        - This script creates all the animations described in the GIFs subdirectory above. 
        
    2) SIGTOR vs. WEAKTOR vs. NONTOR Environments.ipynb
    
        - This script pertains to all plots and analyses involving SIGTOR (EF2+), WEAKTOR (> EF2), and NONTOR simulations. 
        
        - IMPORTANT NOTES/WHAT'S IN THIS SCRIPT
        
            1) Divides out the simulations into SIGTOR, WEAKTOR, and NONTOR categories for plotting purposes.
            
            2) Plots all soundings and forecasting parameters across the entire ensemble into a single figure.
            
            3) Does the same as 2), but plots all of the NONTOR, WEAKTOR, and SIGTOR members in 3 separate figures.
            
            4) Plots all 30 soundings, zoomed in on the lowest 300 mb of the atmosphere, where the color of each sounding 
            represents the simulation category.
            
            5) Plots scatterplots too see if there's any correlation between certain forecasting parameters and the resulting 
            peak TLV intensity of simulations.
            
            6) Plots deviations in storm motions (scatterplots and kernel density estimation plots) computed at 5-minute 
            intervals and over the last hour of simulation time to see if there's any pattern between deviations in Bunkers and 
            times when storms because tornadic/remain nontornadic. 
            
            7) Shaded contour plots of certain environmental variables and forecasting parameters at the time instantaneous 
            soundings were taken, with a scatter plot overlaid showing the locations where each sounding was taken, where the 
            color of individual dots represents the peak TLV intensity of that respective simulation.
            
            8) Timeseries plots showing various variables throughout the length of the simulation, where the colors of the lines 
            represent the different category of simulations. 
            
    3) Tornado Track & Intensity Identification.ipynb
    
        - The script pertains to all plots and analyses regarding TLVs and identifying them in the simulations.
        
        - IMPORTANT NOTES/WHAT'S IN THIS SCRIPT
        
            1) TLVs are identified at 5-minute resolution using the output files of the simulations, and at 30-second resolution 
            using the CM1 stats file.
            
                - The 5-minute resolution TLVs are identified by finding collocated spots of high enough vorticity and ground-
                relative wind (NOT USED IN FINAL VERSION).
                
                - The 30-s resolution TLVs are identified using the minimum surface pressure in the CM1stats file to calculate 
                estimated wind speeds according to the Burgers-Rott Vortex solution to the Navier-Stokes, and using cyclostrophic 
                balance.
                
                    - As is, the EF-scale thresholds and associated pressure minima created sharp transitions between non-
                    tornadic times to tornadic times (ex: nothing to EF2+), and as such the EF-scale thresholds were reduced by 
                    20%, creating a much smoother transition.
                    
            2) Timeseries of select variables like vorticity, surface pressure minima, and vertical velocity are plotted across 
            the entire esemble, with background shading representing times when at least 1 ensemble member is tornadic. Darker 
            shading means more members are tornadic.
            
            3) Timeseries of TLVs intensity across the ensemble are also plotted, with histograms showing the distribution of the 
            peak TLV intensities achieved by each ensemble member.
            
            4) TLV tracks are also plotted, but were too messy and not used in any of the final versions of the thesis or defense 
            presentation.

The Soundings directory is the location where all the input soundings across the ensemble are stored. There is a script in there, "Data Acquisition.ipynb", that is responsible for generating the input soundings that are randomly selected from the parent environment as .txt files, and saving them in this directory.
